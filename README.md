# infinigene
A simple Javascript genome browser using the InfinityDB database engine. The browser runs entirely client-side, and queries the InfinityDB database through a REST API.

# Installation
Launch the InfinityDB database server on a public IP address. Then host browser.html on any webserver. Gene annotations can be added to the database using add_track.py, and genome sequences can be added with build.py.
